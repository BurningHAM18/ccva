# ccva



### DESCRIPTION 

ccva is software that came to my mind watching mr robot series.
It allows you to hide more files into another one (.mp3 , .jpg, .pdf tested) with the possibility of crypt it using the AES256 method


p.s. i am NOT responsible for any damages or data loss. If you will contact me
     saying "i melted my PC" i will only laugh. a lot.
